1.As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of pink and orange, Sarah stood on the edge of the old, wooden pier, staring out at the vast, rippling ocean. 
2.She clutched a weathered letter in her hand, its corners frayed and ink faded from years of rereading. 
3.It was the last message she had from her brother, who had vanished mysteriously five years ago while sailing around the world.
4.Tonight was different, though—tonight, a strange light pulsed on the water’s surface, just beyond the breakers, as if calling to her. 
5.With a deep breath, Sarah stepped off the pier, her heart pounding, ready to follow the light and uncover the truth that had eluded her for so long.
